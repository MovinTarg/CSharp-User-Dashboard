GitHub is a social network hub for programmers. You can look at what other programmers are working on, check their code and make suggestions or changes. You may share projects you are working on and collaborate with other programmers for updates or additional features.

Upload your work for this exercise on GitHub and ask some of your cohort mates or other programmers to peruse your code and suggest changes/updates. Do the same thing for your cohort mates' work
